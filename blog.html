                <p>Difference Between Local Storage and Session Storage</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <b>Local Storage:</b><br> Local storage stores a larger amount of data on the
                    client's computer in a key-value pair format and has no expiration date. Data is never transferred
                    to the server and is accessible via JavaScript and HTML5.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Session Storage:</b><br> Session storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's
                    computer only for the current session, expiring the data on tab close. Data is never transferred to
                    the server and is accessible client-side from the same tab.

                <p>Difference Between Global Scope and Block Scope</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <b>Global Scope:</b><br> Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                    Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Block Scope:</b><br> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or
                    while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables
                    declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope.

                <p>JavaScript Event Loop Runtime Procedure</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                    asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
                    event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event
                    is just a function callback.

                <p>How many ways to get Undefined</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value
                    when no value is assigned before using it. So we can say that undefined means lack of value or
                    unknown value.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We will get undefined value when we call a non-existent property or method of an object.</li>
                    <li>If there is no return value of a function then we can get undefined value</li>
                    <li>Lack of enough argument value and default value of function's argument can responsible for
                        undefined value</li>
                </ul>
